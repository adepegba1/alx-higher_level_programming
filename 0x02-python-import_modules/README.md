## Tasks
- **0. Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3**
  - You have to use print function with string format to display integers
  - You have to assign:
  - the value 1 to a variable called a
    - the value 2 to a variable called b
    - and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
    - a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
  - Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
  - You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
  - You are not allowed to use \* for importing or \__import\__
  - Your code should not be executed when imported - by using \__import\__, like the example below
