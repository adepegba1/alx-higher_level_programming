## Task List
- [0-print_list_integer.py](0-print_list_integer.py) Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
	- Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
	- Format: one integer per line. See example
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You can assume that the list only contains integers
	- You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
	- You have to use str.format() to print integers
- [1-element_at.py](1-element_at.py) Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
	- Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
	- If idx is negative, the function should return None
	- If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You are not allowed to use try/except
- [2-replace_in_list.py](2-replace_in_list.py) Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
	- Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
	- If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
	- If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You are not allowed to use try/except
