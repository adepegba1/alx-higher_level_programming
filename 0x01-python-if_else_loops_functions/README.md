## Task Requirement
- **Python Scripts**
	- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
	- All your files should end with a new line
	- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
	- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
	- All your files must be executable
	- The length of your files will be tested using wc

- **C Scripts**
	- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	- All your files should end with a new line
	- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
	- You are not allowed to use global variables
	- No more than 5 functions per file
	- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
	- Don’t forget to push your header file
	- All your header files should be include guarded
## Task
- **0. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.**
	- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py)
	- The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
	- You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
	- The output of the program should be:
		- The number, followed by
			- if the number is greater than 0: is positive
			- if the number is 0: is zero
			- if the number is less than 0: is negative
		- followed by a new line
- **1. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.**
	- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py)
	- The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
	- You don’t have to understand what import, random.randint do. Please do not touch this code. This line should not change: number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
	- The output of the program should be:
		- The string Last digit of, followed by
		- the number, followed by
		- the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
			- if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
			- if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
			- if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
		- followed by a new line
- **2. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.**
	- You can only use one print function with string format
	- You can only use one loop in your code
	- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
	- You are not allowed to import any module
- **3.
